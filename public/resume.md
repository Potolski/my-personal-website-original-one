## Summary

I am a Senior Smart Contract Engineer and DeFi Protocol Architect with extensive experience leading technical teams across blockchain ecosystems[cite: 3]. I combine deep technical expertise with strong project management skills to deliver successful blockchain solutions[cite: 4]. I understand the importance of soft skills in software development projects and how communication is a key to achieving success[cite: 5].

**My specializations include:** [cite: 6]

* **Blockchain Development:** Smart Contracts (Solidity, Move), UTXO, EVM, and ZK implementations [cite: 6]
* **DeFi Ecosystem:** Protocol architecture, DEXS, DAOs, on-chain KYC, and DID solutions [cite: 6]
* **Development Tools:** Foundry, Hardhat, Tenderly, Infura, and Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). [cite: 6]
* **Cross-chain Solutions:** Layer 1 and Layer 2 applications and integrations [cite: 7]

My technical background also includes experience with C#, F#, Typescript, Flutter, SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, SQLite), and RESTful APIs[cite: 7].

As a Technical Team Lead and Project Manager, I prioritize delivering results while fostering team cohesion and growth. My management is heavily influenced by the books "The Effective Manager," "High Output Management," and "Managing A Programming Project: Processes and People." [cite: 8] I've written about these influences here: [https://medium.com/@davidpotolskilafeta/some-nice-books-to-help-you-with-project-management-f03361a666f5](https://medium.com/@davidpotolskilafeta/some-nice-books-to-help-you-with-project-management-f03361a666f5) [cite: 9]
